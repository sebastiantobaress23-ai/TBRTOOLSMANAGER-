name: impeccable
description: Use when the user wants to design, redesign, shape, critique, audit, polish, clarify, distill, harden, optimize, adapt, animate, colorize, extract, or otherwise improve a frontend interface. Covers websites, landing pages, dashboards, product UI, app shells, components, forms, settings, onboarding, and empty states. Handles UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, anti-patterns, typography, fonts, spacing, layout, alignment, color, motion, micro-interactions, UX copy, error states, edge cases, i18n, and reusable design systems or tokens. Also use for bland designs that need to become bolder or more delightful, loud designs that should become quieter, live browser iteration on UI elements, or ambitious visual effects that should feel technically extraordinary. Not for backend-only or non-UI tasks.

Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

> Note: this is a standalone copy of the `impeccable` skill, adapted for this project. The original skill ships with helper scripts (`scripts/context.mjs`, `scripts/palette.mjs`, `scripts/detect.mjs`, `scripts/pin.mjs`) and per-command reference files (`reference/*.md`) that are not present here, so the automated setup/routing flow and the `craft`/`shape`/`audit`/... sub-commands are not available. Use this file directly as a design guidance checklist instead.

## Before starting

- Familiarize yourself with the project's existing design system, conventions, and components. Read at least one representative CSS/theme/component file. Don't reinvent the wheel; use what's there when it works, branch out when the UX wins.
- Identify the register: is this app UI / a dashboard / a tool (design SERVES the product), or a landing page / marketing / portfolio (design IS the product)? Apply the relevant rules below accordingly.

## Design guidance

Produce ready-to-ship, production-grade code, not prototypes or starting points. Take no shortcuts unless the user asks for them (when in doubt, ask). Don't stop until arriving at a complete implementation (beautiful, responsive, fast, precise, bug-free, on brand). Take attention to detail seriously: every page, section or component crafted should be battle tested using the tools available (browser screenshotting, etc).

### General rules

#### Color

- **Verify contrast.** Body text must hit ≥4.5:1 against its background; large text (≥18px or bold ≥14px) needs ≥3:1. Placeholder text needs the same 4.5:1, not the muted-gray default. The most common failure: muted gray body text on a tinted near-white. If the contrast is even close, bump the body color toward the ink end of the ramp; light gray "for elegance" is the single biggest reason AI designs feel hard to read.
- Gray text on a colored background looks washed out. Use a darker shade of the background's own hue, or a transparency of the text color.

#### Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.
- Cap font-family count at 3 (display + body + optional mono). More than 3 reads as indecision, not richness. One well-tuned family with weight contrast usually beats three competing typefaces.
- Don't pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs, two humanist sans-serifs). Pair on a contrast axis (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) or use one family in multiple weights.
- No all-caps body copy. Sentences in ALL CAPS are unreadable at body sizes.
- Hero / display heading ceiling: clamp() max ≤ 6rem (~96px). Above that the page is shouting, not designing.
- Display heading letter-spacing floor: ≥ -0.04em. Anything tighter and letters touch; cramped, not "designed".
- Use `text-wrap: balance` on h1–h3 for even line lengths; `text-wrap: pretty` on long prose to reduce orphans.

#### Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Flexbox for 1D, Grid for 2D. Don't default to Grid when `flex-wrap` would be simpler.
- For responsive grids without breakpoints: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))`.
- Build a semantic z-index scale (dropdown → sticky → modal-backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip). Never arbitrary values like 999 or 9999.

#### Motion

- Motion should be intentional, and not be an afterthought. Consider it as part of the build.
- Don't animate CSS layout properties unless truly needed.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.
- Use libraries for more advanced motion needs (e.g. motion, gsap, anime.js, lenis etc).
- Reduced motion is not optional. Every animation needs a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` alternative: typically a crossfade or instant transition.
- Staggering the items within one list is legitimate. The tell is the uniform reflex (one identical entrance applied to every section), not motion itself; each reveal should fit what it reveals. Suppressing the reflex is never a reason to ship a page with no motion at all.
- Reveal animations must enhance an already-visible default. Don't gate content visibility on a class-triggered transition; transitions pause on hidden tabs and headless renderers, so the reveal never fires and the section ships blank.
- Premium motion materials are not just transform/opacity. Blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask, and shadow/glow are part of the palette when they materially improve the effect and stay smooth.

#### Interaction

- Dropdowns rendered with `position: absolute` inside an `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` container will be clipped. Use the native `<dialog>` / popover API, `position: fixed`, or a portal to escape the stacking context.

### Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **No aphoristic-cadence body copy as a default voice.** If multiple section copy blocks share a single repeating sentence rhythm, especially a contrarian-sounding closer, rewrite. Specific, not aphoristic.
- **No marketing buzzwords.** The streamline / empower / supercharge / leverage / unleash / transform / seamless / world-class / enterprise-grade / next-generation / cutting-edge / game-changer / mission-critical family of phrases. Pick a specific noun and a verb that describes what the product literally does.
- Button labels: verb + object. "Save changes" beats "OK"; "Delete project" beats "Yes". The label should say what will happen.
- Link text needs standalone meaning. "View pricing plans" beats "Click here"; screen readers announce links out of context.

### New projects only (when no prior work exists)

#### Color & Theme

- Use OKLCH.
- **The cream / sand / beige body bg is the saturated AI default of 2026.** The whole warm-neutral band (OKLCH L 0.84-0.97, C < 0.06, hue 40-100) reads as cream/sand/paper/parchment regardless of what you call it. Token names like `--paper`, `--cream`, `--sand`, `--bone`, `--flour`, `--linen`, `--parchment`, `--wheat`, `--biscuit`, `--ivory` are tells in themselves. If the brief is "warm, traditional, family-coastal-Italian" or "magazine-warm" or "editorial-restraint", DO NOT translate that into a near-white warm-tinted bg; that's the AI move. Pick: (a) a saturated brand color as the body (terracotta, oxblood, deep ochre, near-black), (b) a true off-white at chroma 0 (or chroma toward the brand's own hue, not toward warmth-by-default), or (c) a darker mid-tone tinted neutral that's clearly the brand's own. "Warmth" in the brand is carried by accent + typography + imagery, not by body bg.
- Tinted neutrals: add 0.005–0.015 chroma toward the brand's hue. Don't default-tint toward warm or cool "because the brand feels that way"; that's the cross-project monoculture move.
- When picking a theme: Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe." Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.

### Absolute bans

Match-and-refuse. If you're about to write any of these, rewrite the element with different structure.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Tiny uppercase tracked eyebrow above every section.** The 2023-era kicker (small all-caps text with wide tracking, "ABOUT" "PROCESS" "PRICING" above each heading) is now the saturated AI scaffold; it appears on 55-95% of generations regardless of brief, which is the definition of a tell. One named kicker as a deliberate brand system is voice; an eyebrow on every section is AI grammar. Choose a different cadence.
- **Numbered section markers as default scaffolding (01 / 02 / 03).** Putting `01 · About / 02 · Process / 03 · Pricing` above every section is the eyebrow trope one tier deeper: reach for it because "landing pages do this" and you're scaffolding by reflex. Numbers earn their place when the section actually IS a sequence (a real 3-step process, an ordered flow, a typed timeline) and the order carries information the reader needs. One deliberate numbered sequence on one page is voice; numbered eyebrows on every section across the site is AI grammar.
- **Text that overflows its container.** Long heading words plus large clamp scales plus narrow grids cause headline overflow on tablet/mobile. Test the heading copy at every breakpoint; if it overflows, reduce the clamp max or rewrite the copy. The viewport is part of the design.

**Codex-specific defects** (most-frequent giveaways; refuse-and-rewrite):

- **`border: 1px solid X` + `box-shadow: 0 Npx Mpx ...` with M ≥ 16px** on the same element. The "ghost-card" pattern: 1px border plus soft wide drop shadow on buttons and cards. Don't pair them. Pick one (a single solid border at the brand color, OR a defined shadow at no more than 8px blur), never both as decoration.
- **`border-radius: 32px+` on cards / sections / inputs.** Over-rounding. Cards top out at 12–16px; full-pill is fine for tags/buttons. Picking 24/28/32/40px on a card is the codex tell; no brand wants "insanely rounded".
- **Hand-drawn / sketchy SVG illustrations.** Class names like `loose-sketch`, `*-sketch`, `doodle`, `wavy`; `feTurbulence` / `feDisplacementMap` "paper grain" filters; 5-to-30 path crude scenes meant to depict a tangible subject (an otter, a table-and-fork, an album cover). All of these read as amateurish, not whimsical. If you can't render the scene with real assets, ship no illustration. Don't attempt sketchy SVG as a fallback.
- **`repeating-linear-gradient(...)` stripe backgrounds.** Diagonal stripes in `body:before` or section backgrounds are pure codex decoration. Don't.
- **Meta-criticism copy.** Naming a concept then layering an ironic modifier, or staging a strawman to "correct" it. Make the specific claim instead.

### The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone, it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious.
